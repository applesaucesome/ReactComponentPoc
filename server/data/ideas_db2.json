Some Target guests are confused by conflicting information about what is Ã¢â‚¬Å“healthyÃ¢â‚¬Â, or are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information about health and wellness currently available.  Still other guests want to make positive changes to improve their wellness, but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the time or patience to sort through volumes of information in order to make the decisions that will lead them down the path of good health.

But growing up, her parents and grandparents focused on buying food that was inexpensive versus healthy; so now as a young adult on her own, she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure what Ã¢â‚¬Å“healthyÃ¢â‚¬Â food really is.  She has tried to do some research on the topic, but finds conflicting information that ends up making her feel frustrated and confused; and with her college classes becoming more demanding, she needs to focus more on her course load and less on food research.  <br /><br /> A middle aged adult has always prided himself on being active and healthy; he has played sports all of his life, and eats a mostly nutritious diet.  But as research continues to define which foods really support wellness, he finds himself questioning some of his knowledge and choices.  For example, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure if Greek yogurt is really worth the hype, if vitamin supplements are necessary, etc.  HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also noticing that over the past few years, he has started to gain a little weight Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which was never an issue for him before.  HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure what changes he should make, but knows that he needs to do something if he wants to remain in good shape in the years to come.<br /><br />",
            "idea_solution": "The Just For You Portable Health Guide is a mobile tool that allows a guest to select specific elements of health that they want to focus on Ã¢â‚¬â€œ everything from losing weight, to lowering blood sugar, to increasing bone density, to reducing cholesterol, and on and on.  In the store, when the guest comes across an item that they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure supports their specified health goals, they simply scan the itemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s barcode, and receive instant feedback on whether the item is a good choice, or if there is a better alternative close by.  The just-in-time information instantly clarifies if the item in question supports good health (as defined by the guest), and eliminates the lack of role models or gaps in knowledge of what Ã¢â‚¬ËœhealthyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is compared to the ever-evolving research and resulting information.  Because the guide is so simple to use and provides immediate results, a guestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patience isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t strained, and their already hectic schedule isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t negatively impacted.<br /><br />",

She strives to reduce her stress, spend quality time with her family and provide healthy meals for them. She gets overwhelmed with the entire process of planning and preparing healthy meals, which takes away from her ability to spend time with her family. She becomes paralyzed by the countless recipes on the internet that have too many ingredients or are so complex they take hours to prepare.  As a result, she resorts to the same (not so healthy) meals she always prepares which require less creativity, effort and money.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe needs to be able to prepare a healthy meal in a stress-free way and spend quality time with her family.",
            "idea_guest_insight": "Busy moms that want to prepare healthy meals but the time involved and the complexity of actually preparing the meals is difficult.  Recipes are one of the most googled search terms.  There is also a knowledge gap of how to cook a healthy meal and a perception that healthy doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always equal delicious.  Per guest insights, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Across all segments, motivation is the top barrier to wellness.  Cost and time are also validated as key friction points.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Ã¢â‚¬Å“All segments struggle with eating well consistently and feeling like they have room to improve.Ã¢â‚¬Â  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the marketplace we observed multiple options to satisfy different parts of this need.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhole Foods - From a retailer perspective, Whole Foods has an app that adds to a shopping list, but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t calculate cost and the shopping list isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t user friendly.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBig Oven - another app that lets you search recipes and make filters, adding items to your meal plan and eventually your shopping list.  The app is not tied to a retailer or specific items, and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t show you the value you will get.  There is also no store pickup or home delivery, some of the menu options are difficult to make, and it only addresses planning the meal, not shopping or preparation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHello Fresh - a subscription service that allows the consumer to choose from five recipes each week and you have to choose exactly three.  The recipes are simple and easy to prepare and there is home delivery.  The meals themselves are at higher price point and if you like a meal it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily be a choice the next week.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost options in the market are not focused on simple, healthy meals unless consumers are willing to pay a premium.",
            "idea_solution": "Plan - SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll download the app for free, register (unless she already has Cartwheel or Target.com account), then she gets to choose her meals (from a few choices, trending dishes, 4 star or higher).  There is a filter for food allergies and special dietary needs.  All meals are healthy, easy to cook and prepared in 30 minutes or less.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGrocery shop - Her grocery list is created from the meal selections and the app selects Target grocery items that exist in the store.  She has the option to remove any ingredients from the list if she already has them.  The Cartwheel button at the bottom populates any available coupons, and then calculates the cost of her grocery list.  If she wants to shop in store, the grocery list will display aisle locations.  If she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to shop in-store, she can click buy now and the groceries will be ready for pickup at a set time.  A home delivery option is also available for her convenience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare - Simple step by step instructions and pictures guide her through the meal preparation.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so simple her kids can cook the meal.  She has the option to rate, share and favorite the meal, which creates a feedback loop and continues to personalize the experience.",

Whether an expecting mother wonders when she last felt her babyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kick or her infant cries inconsolably at 3AM, there are so many moments where mom aspires for peace of mind that everything is okay.  She struggles with the stress of the unknown and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rest until she can diagnose or treat her children, even if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ahead of her own needs.  She needs the tools to act in those moments, ultimately empowering her and delivering her the peace of mind she needs.",
            "idea_guest_insight": "When engaging with Target Guests, it quickly became abundantly clear momÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest source of stress and anxiety was worrying about the health of their children. People spent hours searching online, consulting with close confidants, or traveling to and from doctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offices for common treatments, all in search of peace of mind. We found the gap was empowering mom in her moment of need instead of taking the time to search out third party sources. Mom stresses in the moments where she lacks control of her childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health and wants the tools that empower her at that time.  Regardless of her childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s age (Prenatal, Infant, Toddler, etc), she yearns to quickly control that anxiety and obtain greater peace of mind through quick diagnosis and care of her children.",
            "idea_solution": "Today, we know that moms are visiting Target for their own and their families over-the-counter healthcare and Pharmacy needs.<br /><br />\r\nTomorrow, she will be able to rely on Target for new, innovative health care technology products that empower her to diagnose, monitor, and care for her children, regardless of age. For example, an expecting mom can use a new product to check her babyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heartbeat and share a recording with her family and friends.  Similarly, she can check for an ear infection, upload to a doctor, and pick up her prescription at a Target pharmacy without visiting a doctor's office or waiting room. Finally, she will be able to monitor her childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fever in real-time during their recovery.   <br /><br />\r\nMost exciting, she does not know that these products exist and are available to help her.  She will engage with Target in a whole new way through interactive education, engagement with Pharmacy, and Target.com.  Due to the newness, we will fuel her exploration through perfect placement displays and an interactive experience.  Ultimately, these products will empower her and make Target her trusted destination for wellness throughout any of her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life stages.",

Many children spend their inactive time playing video games and apps.  While some game makers have attempted to increase the amount of movement involved in playing their games (Wii, Kinect, etc.), the amount of physical activity involved in playing these games is minimal.  There exists an opportunity to better connect active play with video games, a way to encourage the young gamers to get up and play in the real world.  The PowerChip Active does just this, by tracking the amount of time the child is actively moving during the day, the child earns in-game rewards, called PowerChips.",
            "idea_guest_insight": "Nathan, a 9 year old boy, loves to play video games, where he immerses himself in worlds where building and exploring, beating challenges, and gathering Ã¢â‚¬Å“coinsÃ¢â‚¬Â allow him to level up, gain new challenges, and customize his world and characters.  When asked about why he likes to spend so much time in the games, Nathan answers, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I just want to see what is nextÃ¢â‚¬Â.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\r\nBecky, NathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mom, knows the importance of active play, but struggles with the Nathan to get him up to do it.

The Chip is activated whenever the child moves, tracking the amount of time that this movement is happening (a minimum of 5 minutes of activity is required to Ã¢â‚¬Å“countÃ¢â‚¬Â and be tracked).  They then connect the PowerChip Active to a PowerChip Sync Tower that recognizes the amount of (new) time tracked and adds it into a PowerChip bank within their game system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThrough partnerships with video game and app designers, PowerChip rewards are added into their new games, with exclusive rewards for Ã¢â‚¬Å“purchaseÃ¢â‚¬Â with PowerChips (power and ability upgrades, new missions or challenges, new skins and clothing, and other special customizations).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the PowerChip Active and video games and apps with the embedded PowerChip currency, kids earn the gaming experience they love by getting the physical activity that they need.",

Cost and time are also validated as key friction points.Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“All segments struggle with eating well consistently.Ã¢â‚¬Â<br /><br />\r\nScott also said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to purchase healthy, natural, and organic foods and produce more often, but these items are usually so much more expensive that I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always afford them and stay within my budget.Ã¢â‚¬Â We observed that Scott regularly purchases a variety of snacks and foods for his family, for most of which exist higher-priced, healthier or organic alternatives.<br /><br />\r\nLastly, we also observed how fulfilling it is for Scott to find a deal or receive a discount on a purchase.

While evaluating the options, he could just order out pizza again because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quick and easy, but he feels guilty that he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t providing his family with healthier foods.  Adding to his guilt is the fact that he failed to work out this morning like he had plannedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦again.<br /><br />\r\nScott remembers that he recently downloaded an app that gives deals on healthier food options through Target when he works out.  Scott opens the app and finds an Archer Farms Organic Veggie Pizza and sees he only needs another 200 points to redeem the discount.   Within the app there is also a list of exercises and activities he can do and how many points he will earn for doing each. The points can then be redeemed for any discount he sees. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even the option to sync up a FitBit and earn points for the activity it tracks.<br /><br />\r\nScott then completes various exercises and tracks them in his Target Wellness Program.  On his way home from working out, he redeems the discount on the Archer Farms Veggie Pizza to make for dinner for his family.

            "idea_solution": "Non-invasive technology is becoming available (www.vitastiq.com) that can test your vitamin and mineral levels with just a swipe across your skin. Similar to blood-pressure monitors in drug stores, Target can offer an elegant in-store test for our guests. This allows Target to become a partner in wellness and drive sales in the vitamin aisle. One feature could be a color-coded system in the aisle. If the test displays you're low in B12 (Light Blue) the vitamin jar in store can be light blue.",

These items are packed in branded 'Get Better' kits along with a personalized note (to Charlie) from the pharmacist (or clinician) with the pharmacy (or clinic) phone number (in case Mom/Dad have any questions).
