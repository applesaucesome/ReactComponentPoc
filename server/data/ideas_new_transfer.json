Yet, acting alone, without reinforcing social and economic environments, no individual can achieve their optimal health. <br />\r\nIt isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a simple matter of motivation; the context of peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives determines their health: income and social status, education, physical activity, social support networks, genetics and access to healthy environments are the true determinants of individual health. <br />\r\nWe know our guests are proactive health consumers who care about the health of themselves and their families. The demographic of our guest (with above average education and above average income) means that many of these determinants of health (such as income, social status, education) are relatively constant but an important problem persists: at the point in time when guests are making choices on products that will impact their health, they lack the key social network and incentive that will reinforce the healthy choice. <br />\r\nEnter Cartwheel Healthy Connect. By harnessing the popularity and footprint of Cartwheel and combining it with behavioral science, Cartwheel Healthy Connect reinforces the guest in making healthy choices by winning on price and winning at health.",
